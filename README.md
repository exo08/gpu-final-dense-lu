Dense linear systems frequently arise in computational science, engineering, and numerical simulations, requiring efficient algorithms for solutions. Solving large-scale dense linear systems, represented typically as Ax = b, is computationally intensive due to the complexity of the underlying operations. LU decomposition is a common approach where matrix A is factorized into a product of lower (L) and upper (U) triangular matrices. The challenge is to efficiently implement this decomposition while ensuring numerical stability and accuracy, especially on GPU architectures.
The primary problem explored here is efficiently solving dense linear systems using GPU acceleration, minimizing computational overhead, ensuring numerical stability, and achieving optimal accuracy.
